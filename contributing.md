## Contributing to Purpur

Nanaica is happy you're willing to contribute to our projects. We are usually very lenient with all submitted PRs, but there are still some guidelines you can follow to make the approval process go more smoothly.
Use a Personal Fork and not Organization

Nanaica will routinely modify your PR, whether it's a quick rebase or to take care of any minor nitpicks we might have. Often, it's better for us to solve these problems for you than make you go back and forth trying to fix it yourself.

Unfortunately, if you use an organization for your PR, it prevents Purpur from modifying it. This requires us to manually merge your PR, resulting in us closing the PR instead of marking it as merged.

We much prefer to have PRs show as merged, so please do not use repositories on organizations for PRs.

See isaacs/github#1681 for more information on the issue.
